Book Duckett: 
HTML5 Layout, Chapter 17
in coding a site, developers put the main sections of the page inside <div> elements and use the class or id attributes to write for what they use this part of the page, for example in some part of web page I use to put article so that I make the tag like this <div class="article">

HTML5 have a new element that allow to divide up the parts of a page.
the page in website divided into:
<head><head/>
<body>
<header> header used to put site name and the main navigation <header/>
<main><main/>
<body/>
<footer> footer for the copyright information, links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions <footer/>
And HTML5 have more tags like, <section> It combines portions of document into discrete units that you can describe as related in some way,
The <hgroup> element allows the primary heading for a document section to be grouped with any secondary headings such as subheadings or alternative titles to form a multi-level heading, and we have a lot of tags that help to make the website good.

HTML & CSS, Chapter 18 - Process & Design
when you making a website you must know who is the category of the people that will be used your website, so that's to do coding website fits their age, requirements, etc.
and to make website good for use when the user use it, we can use size, style and colour for the important headline, to design it.
