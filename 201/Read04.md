* image tag: use it to add image tag to page
`<img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="A family of
quokka" title="cat" width="600" height="450"/>`
> > src: put the url inside it
> > alt: put description about the image, to describes the image if you cannot see it
> > title: provide additional information about the image
> > width:specifies the height of the image in pixels

*normal flow*
- position:static
- position:relative: moves tags in relation to where it would have been in normal flow
- float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right
