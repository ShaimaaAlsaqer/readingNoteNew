###### Layout

*normal flow*
- position:static
- position:relative: moves tags in relation to where it would have been in normal flow
- float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right

- position:absolute given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page

- position:fixed positions the element in relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place

- z-index used to control which element sits on top

- float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible

- clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand sides of a box
